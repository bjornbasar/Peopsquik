Framework Peopsquik

A framework based-off of Chukwu Framework

A minified version, removing the bulk from the basic framework, and made it work with as little footprint as possible.

The following were removed:
most of Zend Library (unused from the original framework and/or has some workarounds to reduce the bloat)
simpletest
Scribe
some Core classes (seldomly used which can be added as plugins)

This framework is availble from github.com via:
git://github.com/ian0583/Peopsquik.git
