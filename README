Framework Peopsquik

A fork of Chukwu Framework in http://svn.theredfla.me/svn/framework

This is a lesser version of the framework.

The following were removed:
most of Zend Library (unused from the original framework and/or has some workarounds to reduce the bloat)
simpletest
Scribe
some Core classes (seldomly used which can be added as plugins)

This framework is availble from github.com via:
git://github.com/ian0583/Peopsquik.git

or

https://ian0583@github.com/ian0583/Peopsquik.git

and viewable through: https://github.com/ian0583/Peopsquik
